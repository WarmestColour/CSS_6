        <div class="clearfix">
            <p class="half">Courage the Cowardly Dog follows a dog named Courage, an easily frightened canine who lives in a farmhouse with Muriel and Eustace Bagge near the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas. Abandoned as a puppy, Courage was found in an alleyway by Muriel, a sweet-natured Scottish woman, who fell in love with the pink puppy, and her husband Eustace, a grouchy, selfish, greedy farmer who constantly harasses Courage.</p>

            <p class="half">Courage, Muriel, and Eustace frequently run into monsters, aliens, demons, mad scientists, zombies, and other supernatural perils from myths and legends that Courage must fend off to save his owners, unbeknownst to them. Although most of the creatures that the three faces are frightening or disturbing, some turn out to be sweet and simple in distress. The plot generally uses horror conventions, common to horror films.</p>

            <p>Although episodic, there are a handful of recurring characters in the show's cast, including Courage's sarcastic, sentient computer, the family physician Dr. Vindaloo, the Gypsy fortune-telling chihuahua Shirley the Medium, Eustace's mother 'Ma', and recurring villains, such as Katz and Le Quack.</p>

            <p>In the finale episode "Remembrance of Courage Past", Muriel and Eustace took him to the same vet that kidnapped and launched his parents, after recognizing him from the past, talking to them about speaking to him alone, which was just a facade as he tries to do the same actions to Courage. Courage runs away and is chased through the hospital, trying to open the door to the lab, but the Cruel Veterinarian kidnaps him and takes him to the same rocket ship that launched the latter into space. When Muriel and Eustace attempt to rescue Courage, as well as discover his experiment, he decides that he can't allow his operation and research to be discovered and exposed to the public. He briefly explains the short details of his insane secret experiment to turn earth dogs into superspace dogs to Muriel and Eustace before throwing them into the rocket to be sent into space to prevent them from interfering with his plan.</p>

            <p>However, Courage escapes and is chased around the lab. Courage knocks over a bucket of bolts and screws, causing the Cruel Veterinarian to slip. 30 seconds to launch, Courage tries to open the door to the rocket, but no avail. As the vet nabs him again, Courage screams as loud as he can into the vet's stethoscope, causing him to scream from the pain. While he's distracted by the pain, Courage then grabs the key, unlocks the door and rescues his owners, throwing them to a nearby bin. as he takes off his stethoscope. 8 seconds to launch, the Cruel Veterinarian tries to nab Courage yet again but bangs the rocket's door causing him to almost become unconscious, laughing weakly as Courage locks the Cruel Veterinarian inside the rocket.</p>

            <p>5 seconds to launch, Courage runs a few feet away to his owners. As it reaches T-0, the rocket engines under it ignite and the rocket launches sending the vet into space instead. At the end of the episode, his rocket already crash-landed on a planet, as he opens the door and is then petrified, finding out that all the dogs have survived, including Courage's parents, which meant that his breeding experiment to see that they would turn into super dogs has failed. Out of pure anger by the dogs, he is dragged off in a net and attacked by the vengeful dogs off-screen for his actions. He is heard screaming in pain during the attack.</p>

            <p>Usually in normal situations, Courage is scared, mostly from Eustace's voodoo mask, that Eustace uses to scare Courage. But in situations where Muriel's and Eustace's life is in danger, Courage becomes very brave.</p>

            <p>Besides Courage's bravery, he is also very intelligent and very quick to find solutions to defeat various villains like Katz, Le Quack and other monsters. Courage has a computer that he uses for solving problems and finding answers to his problems.</p>

            <p>Courage is a very kind-hearted dog and he will try to come up with any solutions that might aid others besides his owners, such as the Duck Brothers, Bunny and the Hunchback. Another good quality about Courage is that Muriel's undying love for him is the major source of his strength.</p>
